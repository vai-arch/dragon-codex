      "text": " camps, they probably have a few spies in our meetings.”\n\n“I suppose so.”\n\n“So they know our plan. Our great plan, that we spent so long preparing. They know it.”\n\nElayne hesitated.\n\n“Light\\!” Mat said, shaking his head. “The first and most important rule to winning a war is knowing what your enemy is going to do.”\n\n“I though the first rule was to know your terrain,” Elayne said, folding her arms.\n\n“That, too. Anyway, I realize that if the enemy knows what we re going to do, we have to change. Immediately. Bad battle plans are better than ones your enemy will anticipate.”\n\n“Why didn’t you guess this would happen?” Elayne demanded.\n\nHe looked at her, expressionless. One side of his mouth twitched up, then he pulled his hat down, shading his eyepatch.\n\n“Light,” Elayne said. “You *knew.* You spent this whole week planning with us, and you knew the entire time you’d throw it out with the dishwater.”\n\n“That’s giving me too much bloody credit,” Mat said, looking back at his maps. “I think a part of me might have known all along, but I didn’t figure it out until just before the Sharans got here.”\n\n“So what is the new plan?”\n\nHe didn’t reply.\n\n“You’re going to keep it in your head,” Elayne said, her legs feeling weak. “You’re going to lead the battle, and none of us are going to know what in the Light you’re planning, are we? Otherwise, someone might overhear, and the news would travel to the Shadow.”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“Creator shelter us,” she whispered.\n\nMat scowled. “You know, that’s what Tuon said.”\n\nOn the Heights, Uno held his ears as the nearby dragons belched fire at the Trollocs and Sharans west of them. The scent of something pungent burned in the air, and the blasts were so deafening, he couldn’t hear his own bloody cursing.\n\nDown below, Lan Mandragoran’s riders were sweeping the sides of the assault force, keeping them contained so that the dragons could do more damage. The Sharans had Trollocs with them. They’d have channelers with them, too, lots of them. Farther upriver, another large army of Trollocs, the ones that had done so much damage to Dai Shan’s forces, had come down from the northeast, and would soon reach the Field of Merrilor.\n\nThe dragons stilled momentarily, the dragoners stuffing the maws again with whatever it was that made them work. Uno wasn’t going to step bloody close to them. Bad luck, those were. He was certain of it.\n\nThe leader of the dragoners was a wiry Cairhienin, and Uno had never had much use for those folk. They bloody scowled at him whenever he talked. This one sat haughtily upon his horse, and didn’t flinch when the dragons fired again.\n\nThe Amyrlin Seat had thrown her lot in with these men, and with the Seanchan, too. Uno wasn’t going to flaming complain. They needed every sword they could get, Cairhienin and bloody Seanchan included.\n\n“You like our dragons, Captain?” the leader—Talmanes—called to Uno. Captain. Uno had bloody been promoted. He now led a force of newly recruited Tower pikemen and light cavalry.\n\nHe shouldn’t have been in charge of bloody anything; he had been happy as a regular soldier. But he had both training and battle experience, things that were in slim supply these days, or so Queen Elayne had said. So now he was a flaming officer, and leading cavalry *and* foot soldiers no less\\! Well, he knew his way around a pike, if he had to use one, though he usually preferred to fight on horseback.\n\nHis men were ready to defend the rim of the Heights should the enemy make it up the slope. So far, the archers situated in front of the dragoners had prevented that, but soon enough, the archers would have to pull back, and then it would be bloody regular soldiers doing the bloody fighting. Below, the Sharans pulled aside to let the main Trolloc forces storm up onto the slope.",

      "text": "se than anywhere else along the Border. They still come in the night, but what else can be expected in the spring, if this can be called spring. Scouts return from the Blight—those who do come back—with news of Trolloc camps. Always fresh news of more camps. But we will meet them at Tarwin’s Gap, Dai Shan, and turn them back as we always have.”\n\n“Of course,” Lan said, but he did not sound certain.\n\nIngtar’s grin slipped, but came back immediately. Silently he showed them into Lord Agelmar’s study, then claimed the press of his duties and left.\n\nIt was a room as purpose-made as all the rest of the fortress, with arrowslits in the outer wall and a heavy bar for the thick door, which had its own arrowpiercings and was bound by iron straps. Only one tapestry hung here. It covered an entire wall and showed men, armored like the men of Fal Dara, fighting Myrddraal and Trollocs in a mountain pass.\n\nA table, one chest, and a few chairs were the only furnishings except for two racks on the wall, and they caught Rand’s eye as much as the tapestry. One held a two-handed sword, taller than a man, a more ordinary broadsword, and below them a studded mace and a long, kite-shaped shield bearing three foxes. From the other hung a suit of armor, complete and arranged as one would wear it. Crested helmet with its barred faceguard over a double-mail camail. Mail hauberk, split for riding, and leather undercoat, polished from wear. Breastplate, steel gauntlets, knee and elbow cops, and half-plate for shoulders and arms and legs. Even here in the heart of the Keep, weapons and armor seemed ready to be donned at any moment. Like the furniture, they were simply and severely decorated with gold.\n\nAgelmar himself rose at their entrance and came around the table, littered with maps and sheafs of paper and pens standing in inkpots. He seemed at first glance too peaceful for the room in his blue velvet coat with its tall, wide collar, and soft leather boots, but a second look showed Rand differently. Like all the fighting men he had seen, Agelmar’s head was shaved except for a topknot, and that pure white. His face was as hard as Lan’s, the only lines creases at the corners of his eyes, and those eyes like brown stone, though they bore a smile now.\n\n“Peace, but it is good to see you, Dai Shan,” the Lord of Fal Dara said. “And you, Moiraine Aes Sedai, perhaps even more. Your presence warms me, Aes Sedai.”\n\n*“Ninte calichniye no domashita, Agelmar Dai Shan,”* Moiraine replied formally, but with a note in her voice that said they were old friends. “Your welcome warms me, Lord Agelmar.”\n\n*“Kodome calichniye ga ni Aes Sedai hei.* Here is always a welcome for Aes Sedai.” He turned to Loial. “You are far from the *stedding,* Ogier, but you honor Fal Dara. Always glory to the Builders. *Kiserai ti Wansho hei.*”\n\n“I am unworthy,” Loial said, bowing. “It is you who do me honor.” He glanced at the stark stone walls and seemed to struggle with himself. Rand was glad the Ogier managed to refrain from adding further comment.\n\nServants in black-and-gold appeared on silent, soft-slippered feet. Some brought folded cloths, damp and hot, on silver trays for wiping the dust from faces and hands. Others bore mulled wine and silver bowls of dried plums and apricots. Lord Agelmar gave orders for rooms to be prepared, and baths.\n\n“A long journey from Tar Valon,” he said. “You must be tired.”\n\n“A short journey the path we came,” Lan told him, “but more tiring than the long way.”\n\nAgelmar looked puzzled when the Warder said no more, but he merely said, “A few days’ rest will put you all in fine fettle.”\n\n“I ask one night’s shelter, Lord Agelmar,” Moiraine said, “for ourselves and our horses. And fresh supplies in the morning, if you can spare them. We must leave you early, I am afraid.”",

      "text": "high in Darkfriend councils, he would have killed them both before going near the Waste. The only other possibility made his stomach leaden. “A way has been chosen.” Maybe that had only been to put the word “chosen” down, and maybe it was meant to tell him that one of the Chosen had decided to use him. The note had not come from Lanfear; she would simply have spoken to him in his dreams once more.\n\nIn spite of the heat, he shivered, yet he had to wipe his face again, too. He had the feeling that Lanfear was a jealous mistress to serve, but if another of the Chosen wanted him he would have no choice. Despite all the promises made when he had given his oaths as a boy, he was a man of few illusions. Caught between two of the Chosen, he could be flattened like a kitten beneath a wagon wheel, and they would notice as much as the wagon did. He wished he were home in Saldaea. He wished he could see Teodora again.\n\nA scraping at the door brought him to his feet; for all his bulk, he was more agile than he let anyone see. Mopping his face and neck, he made his way past the brick stove that he certainly had no need for here, and the cabinets with their ornately carved and painted uprights. When he pulled the door open, a slender figure swathed in black robes scurried in past him. He took one quick look around the moonlit darkness to make certain no one was watching—the drivers were all snoring beneath the other wagons and the Aiel guards never came among the wagons themselves—and quickly shut the door again.\n\n“You must be hot, Isendre,” he chuckled. “Take off that robe and make yourself comfortable.”\n\n“Thank you, no,” she said bitterly from the shadowed depths of her cowl. She stood stiffly, but every now and then she twitched; the wool must be even itchier than usual tonight.\n\nHe chuckled again. “As you wish.” Beneath those robes, he suspected, the Maidens of the Spear still allowed her to wear nothing but the stolen jewelry, if that. She had become prudish in ways, since the Maidens had her. Why the woman had been stupid enough to steal, he could not understand. He had certainly made no objections when they dragged her screaming from the wagon by her hair; he was only glad that they had not thought he was involved. Her greediness had certainly made his task more difficult. “Have you anything to report on al’Thor or Natael?” A major part of Lanfear’s instruction had been to keep a close eye on those two, and he knew no better way to keep an eye on a man than to put a woman in his bed. Any man told his bedmate things he had vowed to keep secret, boasted of his plans, revealed his weaknesses, even if he was the Dragon Reborn and this Dawn fellow the Aiel called him.\n\nShe shuddered visibly. “At least I can come near Natael.” Come near him? Once the Maidens had caught her sneaking to the man’s tent, they had practically begun stuffing her into it every night. She always put the best face on matters. “Not that he tells me anything. Wait. Be patient. Keep silent. Make accommodation with fate, whatever that means. He says that every time I try to ask a question. For the most part, all he wants to do is play music I’ve never heard before and make love.” She never had anything more to say about the gleeman. For the hundredth time he wondered why Lanfear wanted Natael watched. The man was supposed to be as high as a Darkfriend could reach, only a step below the Chosen themselves.\n\n“I take it that means you still have not managed to wriggle into al’Thor’s bed?” he asked, brushing past her to sit down on the bed.\n\n“No.” She writhed uncomfortably.",

      "text": "n herself.\n\nThere was a special skill to opening oneself to a circle. It wasn’t terribly difficult to learn, but they didn’t have much time. Fortunately, some of the girls soon picked it up. Yeteri, a petite blonde still in her nightgown, was first. Inala, a coppery and lanky Domani, followed soon after. Egwene eagerly formed a circle with Nicola, and the two other novices. Power flooded into her.\n\nNext, she set about getting the others to practice. She had some inkling, from discussions with the novices during her stay in the Tower, which among them were the most skilled with weaves and the most level-headed. Those weren’t always the most powerful, but that wouldn’t matter if they had a circle backing them up. Egwene hurriedly set them into groups, explaining how to accept the Source through a link. Hopefully, at least some of them would figure it out.\n\nWhat mattered was that Egwene now had the Power. A fair measure of it, almost as much as she was accustomed to without forkroot. She smiled in anticipation, then began a weave, the complexity of it awing several of the novices. “What you are seeing,” Egwene warned, “is something that you are *not* to try, even those of you leading circles. It is far too difficult and dangerous.”\n\nA line of light split the air at the end of the hallway, rotating upon itself. She hoped that the gateway would open in the right location; she was going on Siuan’s instructions, which had been somewhat vague, though she also had Elayne’s original description of the place.\n\n“Also,” Egwene said to the novices in a stern voice, “you are *not* to repeat this weave for anyone without my express permission, not even other Aes Sedai.” She doubted that would be an issue; the weave was complex and few novices would have the skill yet to repeat it.\n\n“Mother?” a hawk-nosed girl named Tamala squeaked. “Are you escaping?” Her voice was edged with fear, and not a little hope, as if Egwene might take her, too.\n\n“No,” Egwene said firmly. “I’ll return in just a moment. When I come back, I want at least five good circles formed\\!”\n\nAnd with Nicola and her two other attendants in tow, Egwene stepped through the gateway into a dark room. She wove a globe of light, and the illumination revealed a storeroom with shelves lining the walls. She let out a relieved sigh. She’d gotten the location right.\n\nThose shelves, along with two short rows of shelves out on the floor, were filled with items of curious design. Crystal globes, small exotic statues, here a glass pendant which reflected blue in the light, there a large set of metal gauntlets lined at the cuffs with firedrops. Egwene strode into the room, leaving the three novices to stare in wonder. They could likely sense what Egwene knew—these were objects of the One Power. *Ter’angreal*, *angreal*, *sa’angreal.* Relics of the Age of Legends.\n\nEgwene scanned the shelves. Items of the Power were infamously dangerous to use if you didn’t know exactly what they did. Any one of these items could kill her. If only. . . .\n\nShe smiled broadly, stepping up to a shelf and sliding a fluted white wand as long as her forearm off the top shelf. She’d found it\\! She held it reverently for a moment, then reached and pulled the One Power through it. An awesome, almost overpowering, torrent of power flooded through her.\n\nYeteri gasped audibly at sensing it. Few women had ever held such power. It surged into Egwene, like a deep breath drawn in. It made her long to roar. She looked at the three novices, smiling broadly. “*Now* we’re ready,” she announced.\n\nLet the *sul’dam* try and shield her while she was wielding one of the most powerful *sa’angreal* that the Aes Sedai possessed. The White Tower would not fall while she was Amyrlin\\! Not without a fight to rival the Last Battle itself.",

      "text": "Perrin did not expect to sleep, but a stomach stuffed with cold stew—his resolve about the roots had lasted until the smells of supper’s leftovers hit his nose—and bone weariness pulled him down on his bed. If he dreamed, he did not remember. He awoke to Lan shaking his shoulders, dawn through the open door turning the Warder to a shadow haloed with light.\n\n“Rand is gone,” was all Lan said before he left at a run, but it was more than enough.\n\nPerrin dragged himself up yawning and dressed quickly in the early chill. Outside, only a handful of Shienarans were in sight, using their horses to drag Trolloc bodies into the woods, and most of those moved as if they should be in a sickbed. A body took time to build back the strength that being Healed took.\n\nPerrin’s stomach muttered at him, and his nose tested the breeze in the hope that someone had already started cooking. He was ready to eat those turnip-like roots, raw if need be. There were only the lingering stench of slain Myrddraal, the smells of dead Trollocs and men, alive and dead, of horses and the trees. And dead wolves.\n\nMoiraine’s hut, high on the other side of the bowl, seemed a center of activity. Min hurried inside, and moments later Masema came out, then Uno. At a trot the one-eyed man vanished into the trees, toward the sheer rock wall beyond the hut, while the other Shienaran limped down the slope.\n\nPerrin started toward the hut. As he splashed across the shallow stream, he met Masema. The Shienaran’s face was haggard, the scar on his cheek prominent, and his eyes even more sunken than usual. In the middle of the stream, he raised his head suddenly and caught Perrin’s coat sleeve.\n\n“You’re from his village,” Masema said hoarsely. “You must know. Why did the Lord Dragon abandon us? What sin did we commit?”\n\n“Sin? What are you talking about? Whyever Rand went, it was nothing you did or didn’t do.” Masema did not appear satisfied; he kept his grip on Perrin’s sleeve, peering into his face as if there were answers there. Icy water began to seep into Perrin’s left boot. “Masema,” he said carefully, “whatever the Lord Dragon did, it was according to his plan. The Lord Dragon would not abandon us.” *Or would he? If I were in his place, would I?*\n\nMasema nodded slowly. “Yes. Yes, I see that, now. He has gone out alone to spread the word of his coming. We must spread the word, too. Yes.” He limped on across the stream, muttering to himself.\n\nSquelching at every other step, Perrin climbed to Moiraine’s hut and knocked. There was no answer. He hesitated a moment, then went in.\n\nThe outer room, where Lan slept, was as stark and simple as Perrin’s own hut, with a rough bed built against one wall, a few pegs for hanging possessions, and a single shelf. Not much light entered through the open door, and the only other illumination came from crude lamps on the shelf, slivers of oily fat-wood wedged into cracks in pieces of rock. They gave off thin streamers of smoke that made a layer of haze under the roof. Perrin’s nose wrinkled at the smell.\n\nThe low roof was only a little higher than his head. Loial’s head actually brushed it, even seated as he was on one end of Lan’s bed, with his knees drawn up to make himself small. The Ogier’s tufted ears twitched uneasily. Min sat cross-legged on the dirt floor beside the door that led to Moiraine’s room, while the Aes Sedai paced back and forth in thought. Dark thoughts, they must have been. Three paces each way was all she had, but she made vigorous use of the space, the calm on her face belied by the quickness of her step.\n\n“I think Masema is going crazy,” Perrin said.\n\nMin sniffed. “With him, how can you tell?”\n\nMoiraine rounded on him, a tightness to her mouth. Her voice was soft. Too soft. “Is Masema the most important thing in your mind this morning, Perrin Aybara?”",

      "text": "?” Elayne asked. “Are you going to talk to me, or do you wish to ogle me further?”\n\n“If I can’t ogle you, whom can I ogle?” Rand asked.\n\n“Don’t grin at me like that, farmboy,” she said. “Sneaking into my tent? Really. What would people say?”\n\n“They’d say that I wanted to see you. Besides, I didn’t sneak in. The guards let me in.”\n\nShe folded her arms. “They didn’t tell me.”\n\n“I asked them not to.”\n\n“Then, for all intents and purposes, you *were* sneaking.” Elayne brushed by him. She smelled wonderful. “Honestly, as if Aviendha weren’t enough . . .” “I didn’t want the regular soldiers to see me,” Rand said. “I worried it would disturb your camp. I asked the guards not to mention that I was here.” He stepped up to her, resting his hand on her shoulder. “I had to see you again, before . . .”\n\n“You saw me at Merrilor.”\n\n“Elayne . . ”\n\n“I’m sorry,” she said, turning back to him. “I *am* happy to see you, and I *am* glad you came. I’m just trying to get into my head how you fit into all of this. How *we* fit into all of this.”\n\n“I don’t know,” Rand said. “I’ve never figured it out. I’m sorry.”\n\nShe sighed, sitting down in the chair beside her desk. “I suppose it is good to find there are some things you can’t fix with a wave of your hand.” “There is much I can’t fix, Elayne.” He glanced at the desk, and the maps. “So much.”\n\n*Don't think about that.*\n\nHe knelt before her, getting a cocked eyebrow until he placed his hand on her belly—hesitantly, at first. “I didn’t know,” he said. “Not until just recently, the night before the meeting. Twins, it is said?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“So Tam will be a grandfather,” Rand said. “And I will be . . .”\n\nHow was a man supposed to react to this news? Was it supposed to shake him, upend him? Rand had been given his share of surprises in life. It seemed he could no longer take two steps without the world changing on him.\n\nBut this . . . this wasn’t a surprise. He found that deep down, he’d hoped that someday he would be a father. It had happened. That gave him warmth. One thing was going right in the world, even if so many had gone wrong.\n\nChildren. *His* children. He closed his eyes, breathing in, enjoying the thought.\n\nHe would never know them. He would leave them fatherless before they were even born. But, then, Janduin had left Rand fatherless—and he had turned out all right. Just a few rough edges, here and there.\n\n“What will you name them?” Rand asked.\n\n“If there is a boy, I’ve been thinking of naming him Rand.”\n\nRand let himself go still as he felt her womb. Was that motion? A kick? “No,” Rand said softly. “Please do not name either child after me, Elayne. Let them live their own lives. My shadow will be long enough as it is.” “Very well.”\n\nHe looked up to meet her eyes, and he found her smiling with fondness. She rested a smooth hand on his cheek. “You will be a fine father.”\n\n“Elayne—”\n\n“Not a word of it,” she said, raising a finger. “No talk of death, of duty.” “We cannot ignore what will happen.”\n\n“We needn’t dwell on it either,” she said. “I taught you so much about being a monarch, Rand. I seem to have forgotten one lesson. It is all right to plan for the worst possibilities, but you must not bask in them. You must not fixate on them. A queen must have hope before all else.”\n\n“I do hope,” Rand said. “I hope for the world, for you, for everyone who must fight. That does not change the fact that I have accepted my own death.”\n\n“Enough,” she said. “No more talk of this. Tonight, I will have a quiet dinner with the man I love.”\n\nRand sighed, but rose, seating himself in the chair beside hers as she called to the guards at the tent flap for their meal.\n\n“Can we at least discuss tactics?” Rand asked. “I am truly impressed by what you’ve done here. I don’t think I could have done a better job.”\n\n“The great captains did most of it.”",

And that is all I know that might help locate them.”\n\nRand had heard all that before; it seemed he had heard all Asmodean had to say of the Forsaken fifty times already. So often that at moments it seemed he had always known what the man was telling him. Some of it he almost wished he had never learned—what Semirhage found amusing, for instance—and some made no sense. Demandred had gone over to the Shadow because he envied Lews Therin Telamon? Rand could not imagine envying someone enough to do anything because of it, and surely not that. Asmodean claimed it had been the thought of immortality, of endless Ages of music, that had seduced him; he claimed to have been a noted composer of music, before. Senseless. Yet in that mass of often blood-chilling knowledge might lie keys to surviving Tarmon Gai’don. Whatever he told Moiraine, he knew he would have to face them then, if not before. Emptying the goblet, he set it on the floor tiles. Wine would not wash out facts.\n\nThe bead curtain rattled, and he looked over his shoulder as *gai’shain* entered, white-robed and silent. While some began gathering up the food and drink that had been laid out for him and the chiefs, another, a man, carried a large silver tray to the table. On it were covered dishes, a silver cup, and two large, green-striped pottery pitchers. One would hold wine, the other water. A *gai’shain* woman brought in a gilded lamp, already lit, and set it beside the tray. Through the windows, the sky was beginning to take on the yellow-red of sunset; in the brief time between baking and freezing, the air actually felt comfortable.\n\nRand stood as the *gai’shain* departed, but did not follow immediately. “What do you think of my chances when the Last Battle comes, Natael?”\n\nAsmodean hesitated in pulling red-and-blue-striped wool blankets from behind his cushions and looked up at him, head tilted in that sideways manner of his. “You found . . . something . . . in the square the day we met here.”\n\n“Forget that,” Rand said harshly. There had been two, not one. “I destroyed it, in any case.” He thought Asmodean’s shoulders slumped a trifle.\n\n“Then the—Dark One—will consume you alive. As for me, I intend to open my veins the hour I know he is free. If I get the chance. A quick death is better than what I’ll find elsewhere.” He tossed the blankets aside and sat staring glumly at nothing. “Better than going mad, certainly. I’m as subject to that as you, now. You broke the bonds that protected me.” There was no bitterness in his voice, only hopelessness.\n\n“What if there was another way to shield against the taint?” Rand demanded. “What if it could be removed somehow? Would you still kill yourself then?”\n\nAsmodean’s barked laugh was utterly acid. “The Shadow take me, you must be beginning to think you really are the bloody Creator\\! We are dead. Both of us. Dead\\! Are you too blind with pride to see it? Or just too thick-witted, you hopeless shepherd?”\n\nRand refused to be drawn. “Then why not go ahead and end it?” he asked in a tight voice. *I wasn’t too blind to see what you and Lanfear were up to. I wasn’t too thick-witted to fool her and trap you.* “If there’s no hope, no chance, not the smallest shred . . . then why are you still alive?”",

      "text": "om behind. Again a look of surprise from Slayer. The man bared his teeth, pulling back, keeping a wary eye on the two remaining wolves, Hopper and Boundless. Slayer's forearm was bleeding where Hopper had bitten him.\n\n\"How is the dome created, Luc?\" Perrin said. \"Show me and leave. I will let you depart.\"\n\n\"Bold words, cub,\" Slayer snarled back. \"For one who just watched me kill one of your pack.\"\n\nBoundless howled in anger, leaping forward. Perrin attacked at the same time, but the ground beneath them trembled, shaking.\n\nNo, Perrin thought. His own footing became firm as Boundless was knocked to the ground.\n\nSlayer lunged, and Penin raised his hammer to block—but Slayer's weapon turned into smoke and passed right through it, solidifying on the other side. With a yelp, Perrin tried to pull back, but the blade scored him across the chest, cutting through his shirt and leaving a gash from one arm to the other. It flared with pain.\n\nPerrin gasped, stumbling backward. Slayer drove forward, but something crashed into him from above. Hopper. Once again the grizzled wolf bore Slayer to the ground, growling, fangs flashing.\n\nSlayer cursed and kicked the wolf free. Hopper went flying with a whimper of pain, tossed some twenty feet. To the side, Boundless had caused the earth to stop rumbling, but had hurt his paw.\n\nPerrin shook himself free of his pain. Slayer was strong in control over this world. Perrin's hammer felt sluggish whenever he swung, as if the air itself were thicker.\n\nSlayer had smiled when he'd killed Oak Dancer. Perrin moved forward, enraged. Slayer was on his het and retreating back down the hillside, toward the trees. Perrin chased after him, ignoring his wound. It wasn't bad enough to stop him, though he did imagine a bandage in place on it, his clothing mended and tight against his chest to stanch the blood.\n\nHe entered the trees just behind Slayer. The branches closed overhead,\n\nand vines whipped from the darkened shadows. Perrin didn't bother fighting them off. Vines didn't move like that. They couldn't touch him. Sure enough, as soon as they grew close, they withered and fell still.\n\nSlayer cursed, then began to move in bursting steps, leaving a blur behind him. Perrin followed, enhancing his own speed.\n\nPerrin didn't consciously make the decision to drop to four legs, but in a heartbeat he had done so, chasing after Slayer as he'd hunted the white stag.\n\nSlayer was fast, but he was merely a man. Young Bull was part of the land itself, the trees, the brush, the stones, the rivers. He moved through the forest like a breeze blowing through a hollow, keeping pace with Slayer gaining on him. Each log in Slayer's way was an obstruction, but to Young Bull each was just a part of the pathway.\n\nYoung Bull leaped to the side, paws against the tree trunks pushing him when he turned. He soared, over stones and rocks, leaping from one to the next, leaving a blur in the air behind him.\n\nSlayer smelled afraid for the first time. He vanished, but Young Bull followed, appearing in the field where the army camped, beneath the shadow of the large stone sword. Slayer looked over his shoulder and cursed, vanishing again.\n\nYoung Bull followed. The place where the Whitecloaks had made camp.\n\nThe top of a small plateau.\n\nA cavern burrowed into a hillside.\n\nThe middle of a small lake. Young Bull ran upon the surface with ease.\n\nEach place Slayer went, he followed, each moment growing closer. There was no time for swords, hammers, or bows. This was a chase, and Young Bull was the hunter this time. He—\n\nHe leaped into the middle of a field, and Slayer wasn't there. He smelled where the man had gone, however. He followed him, and appeared in another place on the same field. There were scents of places all around. What?",

      "text": "hard on the top of his head with her knuckles\\! “Your superstitions are bad enough, Matrim, but I won’t tolerate lies. An amusing lie, true, but still a lie.”\n\n“It’s the Light’s own truth,” he protested, clapping his hat on. Maybe it would give him some protection. “You could learn for yourself if you could make yourself talk to an Aes Sedai. They could tell you about the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn.”\n\n“It could be the truth,” Edesina piped up as if she were being helpful. “The Aelfinn can be reached through a *ter’angreal* in the Stone of Tear, so I understand, and supposedly they give true answers.” Mat glared at her. A fat lot of help she was, with her “so I understands” and “supposedlies.” Tuon continued to stare at him as if Edesina had not opened her mouth.\n\n“I answered your question, Tuon, so you answer mine.”\n\n“You know that *damane* can tell fortunes?” She gave him a stern look, likely expecting him to call it superstition, but he nodded curtly. Some Aes Sedai could Foretell the future. Why not a *damane*? “I asked Lidya to tell mine just before I landed at Ebou Dar. This is what she said. ‘Beware the fox that makes the ravens fly, for he will marry you and carry you away. Beware the man who remembers Hawkwing’s face, for he will marry you and set you free. Beware the man of the red hand, for him you will marry and none other.’ It was your ring that caught my eye first.” He thumbed the long ring unconsciously, and she smiled. A small smile, but a smile. “A fox apparently startling two ravens into flight and nine crescent moons. Suggestive, wouldn’t you say? And just now you fulfilled the second part, so I knew for certain it was you.” Selucia made a sound in her throat, and Tuon waggled fingers at her. The bosomy little woman subsided, adjusting her head scarf, but the look she shot at Mat should have been accompanied by a dagger in her hand.\n\nHe laughed mirthlessly. Blood and bloody ashes. The ring was a carver’s try-piece, bought only because it stuck on his finger; he would give up those memories of Hawkwing’s face along with every other old memory, if it would get the bloody snakes out of his head; and yet those things had gained him a wife. The Band of the Red Hand would never have existed without those old memories of battles.\n\n“Seems to me being *ta’veren* works on me as much as it does on anybody else.” For a moment, he thought she was going to rap him again. He gave her his best smile. “One more kiss before you leave?”\n\n“I’m not in the mood at the moment,” she said coolly. That hanging magistrate was back. All prisoners to be condemned immediately. “Perhaps later. You could return to Ebou Dar with me. You have an honored place in the Empire, now.”\n\nHe did not hesitate before shaking his head. There was no honored place waiting for Leilwin or Domon, no place at all for the Aes Sedai or the Band. “The next time I see Seanchan, I expect it will be on the field somewhere, Tuon.” Burn him, it would be. His life seemed to run that way no matter what he did. “You’re not my enemy, but your Empire is.”\n\n“Nor are you my enemy, husband,” she said coolly, “but I live to serve the Empire.”\n\n“Well, I suppose you’d better get your things. . . .” He trailed off at the sound of a cantering horse approaching.\n\nVanin reined in a rangy gray beside Tuon, eyed Karede and the other Deathwatch Guards, then spat through a gap in his teeth and leaned on the high pommel of his saddle. “There’s ten thousand or so soldiers at a little town about five miles west of here,” the fat man told Mat. “Only one man Seanchan, near as I could learn. Rest are Altarans, Taraboners, Amadicians. All mounted. Thing is, they’re asking after fellows wearing armor like that.” He nodded toward Karede. “And rumor says the one of them that kills a girl that sounds a lot like the High Lady gets himself a hundred thousand crowns gold. Their mouths are dripping for it.”\n\n“I can slip past them,” Karede said. His bluff face looked fatherly. His voice sounded like a drawn sword.",

      "text": "m to Aes Sedai. Until that very morning. This was the first chance Elayne had had to see what was worth keeping. The Light send that the Darkfriends had not gotten away with anything important; they had taken some, but certainly less than a quarter of what the room had held, rubbish included. The Light send she found something they could use. People had died to bring these things out of the Rahad.\n\nShe did not channel, just held the Power as she lifted each item. A chipped clay cup, three broken plates, a child’s moth-eaten dress, and an old boot with a hole worn through the side all fell to the ground. A stone carving a little larger than her hand—it *felt* like stone; it *might* have been a carving, though it did not exactly look carved, for some reason—all deep blue curves vaguely like roots. It seemed to warm faintly at her touch; it held a . . . resonance . . . to *saidar*. That was the closest word she could think of. What it was meant to do, she had no idea, but it was a *ter’angreal* without any doubt. It went on the other side of her, away from the pile of rubbish.\n\nThe heap of refuse continued to grow, but so did the other, if more slowly, things that had nothing in common except the faint warmth and the sense of echoing the Power. A small box that felt like ivory, covered in wavering red and green stripes; she set it down carefully without opening the hinged lid. You could never tell what might trigger a *ter’angreal*. A black rod no thicker than her little finger, a pace in length, stiff yet so flexible she thought she could have doubled it into a circle. A tiny stoppered vial that might have been crystal, with a dark red liquid inside. The figure of a stout, bearded man with a jolly smile, holding a book; two feet tall, it appeared to be age-darkened bronze and took both of her hands to move. Other things. Most was trash, though. And none was what she truly wanted. Not yet.\n\n“Is this the time to be doing that?” Nynaeve asked. She straightened hastily from the small cluster of *ter’angreal*, grimacing and rubbing her hand on her skirt. “That rod feels like . . . pain,” she muttered. The hard-faced woman holding the packhorse’s head blinked at the rod and edged away.\n\nElayne eyed the rod—Nynaeve’s occasional impressions about objects she touched could be useful—but she did not stop sorting. There had been too much pain lately to need any more, surely. Not that what Nynaeve sensed was always that straightforward. The rod might have been present when a great deal of pain was caused without being the cause in itself. The pannier was almost empty; some of what was on the other side of the horse would have to be shifted to balance the weight. “If there’s an *angreal* in this somewhere, Nynaeve, I would like to find it before Moghedien taps one of us on the shoulder.”\n\nNynaeve grunted sourly, but she peered into the wicker basket.\n\nDropping another table leg—that made *three*, none of which matched—Elayne spared a glance for the clearing. All of the packhorses were out, and the mounts were coming through the gateway, now, filling the open space between the trees with bustle and confusion. Merilille and the other Aes Sedai already sat their saddles, barely concealing their impatience to be off, while Pol fussed hurriedly with her mistress’s saddlebags, but the Windfinders.",

      "text": "Having taken to gambling with young Tairen nobles, Mat was caught in aBubble of evilin which his playing cards came to life and tried to kill him.[22]During theTrollocattack on the Stone, Mat killed aGray Manthat had come after him, and then was saved from aMyrddraalby a group of Trollocs.[21][23]\n\nMat wandered through the Stone's collection ofangrealandter'angreal, and later decided to enter theTwisted redstone doorframewhich Egwene had told him about. Theter'angrealdoorway took him to the land of theAelfinn, snakelike creatures with oracular powers. After answering Mat's questions, and possibly in a panic about multipleta'vereninside their world (Rand - as well as Moiraine - passed through the doorframe during this same time period), they prophesied that:\n\n- He would go to Rhuidean.[24]\n- If he does not go to Rhuidean he will die.[24]\n- He would die, because he will have sidestepped fate and would be killed by \"those who do not want that fate fulfilled.\"[24]\n\nHe then refuses to leave when told, and while he is fighting is given more answers for asking what fate they were talking about before being thrown out.\n\n- To marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons.[24]\n- To die and live again, and live once more as part of what was.[24]\n- To give up half the light of the world to save the world.[24]\n\nHe thereafter learned that Rand required an interpreter in the world of the Aelfinn. Mat, however, was able to understand the dialect of theOld Tonguethe Aelfinn were speaking.[24]A bit unnerved, he followed Rand toRhuidean, in theAiel Waste, along with Egwene, Moiraine, andLan. When Rand was granted permission to enter Rhuidean, Mat also asked to enter.[25]Only after Rand told theWise Onesthat if he were to enter, then Mat could enter as well, did they consent.\n\nIn the city Rhuidean, while Rand discovered hisAielheritage, Mat found another red stone doorway. Still feeling cheated concerning the answers he received from the Aelfinn, he decided to enter. However, this redstoneter'angrealbrought him instead to the land of theEelfinn, who resemble foxes instead of snakes. He was expecting to get answers to more questions from Aelfinn, so when the Eelfinn offered him wishes instead, Mat glared at them, feeling cheated. His wishes were:\n\n- To have the holes in his memories filled,[26]\n- To be free from theOne Powerand Aes Sedai,[26]\n- To be away from the Eelfinn and return to Rhuidean if they would not answer his questions.[26]\n\nSince Mat did not set the price, the Eelfinn set a price for him, apparently taking delight while calling him a fool. As granted, Mat now has the memories of countless historical military leaders, thus privy to over a thousand years of cultural and military knowledge; he has afoxhead medallionthat causes flows of the One Power to simply dissolve when applied to him; and Mat was found by Rand hanging by the neck in Rhuidean, suspended from a black-hafted spear set across two tree branches.[26]Rand managed to revive Mat; however, Mat still has a scar around his neck, which he constantly covers with a scarf when not alone. He also decided to keep the spear, actually aPower-wrought[verify][27]naginata-like weapon called anashandarei, which has become his signature weapon.[28]"

      "text": "A side effect of his filled-in memories is that he is now completely fluent in the Old Tongue (whereas before he would only occasionally shout a few phrases in the language in the heat of battle), although often with varying accents.[29]Mat is poisoned somewhere after Rhuidean from being slobbered on by aDarkhound, which Rand kills withbalefire(undoing the actual poisoning to a degree and preventing Mat's death).[30]Mat faces death once more during Rand's invasion of Caemlyn; he was killed, along withAviendhaandAsmodean, by Rahvin's channeling.[31]However, shortly afterward, Rand killed Rahvin with enough balefire to undo those deaths and permanently kill Rahvin. This fulfills the first Aelfinn prophecy; therefore releasing Mat as the current Hornsounder and breaking his link with the Horn of Valere, leaving it open for anyone to use it.[32][33]\n\nSpeaking to Rand about his claim to great age as the reincarnation ofLews Therin, Moiraine says, \"You may have the memories of a man four centuries old, Rand al’Thor, but that does not make you ancient. Otherwise, Matrim Cauthon would be the patriarch of us all.”[34]\n\nDespite having a substantial aversion to being a warrior, Mat is now a Marshal-General to theBand of the Red Handas a result of his memories from dead men. He remembers battles and strategies which have been lost for centuries. He is also extremely lucky at (especially games of) random chance.\n\nAt games like dice or cards, he wins almost all of the time. However, the situation or game must be random chance; in games of skill and order, such asStones, he must rely on his memories and own wit for help. It should be noted however, in certain cases, Mat can lose if it is the best outcome. Rand and Perrin are also known to alter chance asta'veren, but the effect is not so consistently beneficial specifically in their favor; a man near Rand may fall out a fourth-story window and land without a scratch, but another may trip on a tuft of grass and break his neck.\n\nMat's memories raise questions as to the nature of reincarnation through the Wheel; Mat remembers dying, \"more times than he could count,\" but whether his memories are from many individual lives, or are the memories of a single person who has been re-woven into the Pattern many times, most recently as Mat Cauthon, has not been established. It's also possible that the memories are those who previously received wishes from the Eelfinn, as they rummage through the sensations of their visitors.\n\nJust before the Battle ofCairhienagainst theShaido, Mat attempted to leave Rand's company permanently; but luck, chance and, alarmingly, a sense of responsibility drew him increasingly and unwittingly into the fight; in the end, his luck, battle lore, and sense of duty to those in danger took him to the forefront of the conflict, where he personally slewCouladin, the Shaido leader and falseCar'a'carn, and helped bring victory for theDragon Reborn. He also gained the allegiance of a number of soldiers who would follow him into the Pit of Doom if he so led them. This new army is known asShen an Calhar, theBand of the Red Hand, and is personally loyal to Mat, believing that with his luck at their head, they cannot be beaten.\n\nThe original Band of the Red Hand dates back to Manetheren, and was a unit of legendary heroes during theTrolloc Wars. They were the last to fall, guardingKing Aemonwhen Manetheren died. The huge battles during the Trolloc Wars, accompanied by armies of 300,000 men or more, required a detailed command structure to keep everyone and everything from falling apart."

      "text": "Mat sneaks into Ebou Dar.[38]He tries to get a pulse of the city while sorting through his feelings forTuon. Upon learning that her highest ranking general is trying to assassinate her, he decides to do something about it- in a way that only Mat can pull off- by scaling up four[39]floors along the outside of theTarasin Palacein order torescuehis wife. As he sneaks into his wife's room, an arrow shaft just misses him. Selucia waits in the Empresses chambers, having killed two assassins already. She grudgingly guides Mat to her current whereabouts, which are in the Tarasin gardens. Mat makes his way there and watches Tuon, as she practices combat forms, surrounded by the Deathwatch guards. His sight keeps slipping off a gardener there. By instinct he throws a knife at the gardener, who is actually a Gray Man. The Deathwatch Guard charge forward and pin Mat to the ground, having not even noticed the would-be assassin. Tuon tells them to let Mat go. She then disrobes and the two passionately kiss. Mat asks if Tuon will ever love him. She replies that an Empress never loves, but she admits that it is good to see Mat. They then spend the night together.\n\nRand appears before Tuon, unarmed and shielded, and admits that he used Mat to track her down. While staring at possible execution, Rand and Mat begin comparing exploits, trying to one-up the other. After Rand concludes that theCleansing of saidintrumps all Mat's accomplishments, he begins to rip apart Tuon's logic behind her right to rule; forcing her to admit that he is Dragon Reborn and that he held dominion over these lands well beforeArtur Hawkwingbegan theConsolidation, asLews Therin Telamon. He gives her a powerful omen to support his Peace, by singing a song that causes the garden to grow right before their eyes; a song that Mat thinks sounds like an old tavern song. After disputing the borders ofAlmoth Plainand theMarath'damanecaptured in the main land, Rand and the Empress agree to sign theDragon's Peace, and the Seanchan decide to enter the Last Battle by helping the overwhelmed forces of the White Tower. Before Mat leaves, he tells Rand that he saved Moiraine, thereby beating the cleansing of the source. Rand laughs.[40]\n\nTuon promotes Mat torodholderwhich means that if the surviving leaders of the army shall die he will become the leader of the army, making him third in line to command theSeanchanforces. She also renames him Knotai. A messenger arrives stating that the Aes Sedai army has suffered a grievous loss. Mat can sense that Fortuona is deliberating on whether to help or not and pleads with her, reminding her of the Dragon's treaty she signed. Fortuona places her faith in Mat and allows him to takes charge of the army, and prepare them to defend the White Tower forces.\n\nMat is given command of all the Light's forces after Hessalam uses compulsion on theGreat captains. He organizes a final stand at the Fields of Merrilor, where he defeats Demandred's forces made of the combined might of the Shadow and Shara. In particular, during the Last Battle, the Light's forces are positioned primarily on the East side of a river while a Trolloc army approaches from the North and a combined Trolloc/Sharan army approaches from the West. Mat's strategy during the Last Battle is to occupy (and then deliberately give up) the Heights, while focusing on annihilating the Northern Trolloc army first. Mat allocates only token resistance to Demandred damming the river, and coordinates with Tuon to feign a Seanchan retreat, which prompts Demandred to move the Western Sharan/Trolloc army to leave the Heights and begin to crush the Light's forces (specifically, the Andorans) and move further East over where the river used to flow prior to the damming. At this point, Mat moves various armies (Borderlanders / Two Rivers archers, etc.) back to the Heights to surround the Western Sharan/Trolloc army. A quick series of actions including (i) Lan killing Demandred, (ii) the Horn of Valere being blown, (iii) un-damming of the river by Hinderstap volunteers, (iv) Egwene killing Mazrim Taim and wiping out the Sharan channelers and (v) the return of the Dragons shooting out of gateways from a remote location, and (vi) the return of the Seanchan army that earlier feigned retreat cause the Sharan/Trolloc army to be totally destroyed.\n\nDuring the Last Battle, the Horn of Valere was sounded byOlver. Allegedly, Mat's death and subsequent revival inCaemlynduring the fight againstRahvinbroke his bond with the Horn, allowing another to sound it. This is later clarified by the Heroes of the Horn at the Last Battle; Rahvin originally killed Mat during the invasion of Caemlyn, but was revived when Rand used balefire to erase Rahvin from existence before he had killed Mat.\n\nAfter the battle at the Fields of Merrilor, Mat travels withOlverto Shayol Ghul via to'raken which he claims is the second worst idea he's ever had (kidnappingTuonwas the worst). There he finds Rand's forces overrun and nearly beaten, and all sides under attack byMashadar. While Mat is talking to Perrin Mashadar touches Mat, who feigns his death as he discovers that he is immune to its effects on account of having suffered them previously.Padan Fain, who is calling himselfShaisam, finds Mat lying on the ground, pretending to be dead. Mat rises up, surprising him, steals the dagger and rams it between Shaisam's ribs in to the heart. Mat kills Mashadar's host,Padan Fain, and Mashadar is destroyed. Mat then walks away leaving the dagger to melt away along with Fain.\n\nMat return to Merrilor and theSeanchancamp where he meets up withTuon. Mat raises his hand andAludralaunches fireworks above the camp. Tuon informs Mat that she is pregnant with his child. Now that she has an heir she could kill Mat if she wants. Mat grins and asks her 'Tell me, do you ever play dice?'."

Elayne's other warder (Birgitte Silverbow) is a bit upset at being able to feel the heir's emotions and gets drunk to block them out. While both Aviendha and Min had consummated their relationships with Rand previously, they also politely try to block it out.

Rand's body hums, inside his head, louder and louder until...\n\nRand wakes up with a headache and recalls his fall from wall where he watched theAes Sedaimarch Logain throughCaemlyn. A girl dressed in rich clothes kneels beside him and he cannot help but compare her beauty toEgwene's. A sound announces the approach of another, a boy around Rand's age dressed as richly as the girl. Through their discussion, Rand learns that their names areElayneandGawyn. In a slight panic, Rand tries to stand so he can climb back over the wall when a wave of dizziness strikes him.Elaynetreats his injuries as is her hobby with hurt animals. As they talk of personal issues, Rand finally asks who their mother is. Gawyn tells him that she is \"Morgase, by the Grace of the Light,Queen of Andor, Defender of the Realm, Protector of the People,High SeatofHouse Trakand.\"[1]\n\nThe shock appears to cure his dizziness as he races to his feet and tries to leave. Gawyn asks his name, perplexed by his features and accent, and appears surprised by the answer. A voice interrupts their conversation.Galadappears ready to defend his siblings from the intruder but Elayne and Gawyn defend Rand, granting him guest right. An argument ensues, ending with Elayne's rude dismissal of Galad. Galad leaves and the siblings agree that Rand should leave before Galad reports his presence to theQueen's Guards. Elayne insists that Rand use a gate rather than climb back up, however, and in this delay the guards appear.\n\nThe guards surround Rand with swords and bows drawn. Elayne and Gawyn shield Rand with arms raised. Elayne challenges Guardsman-LieutenantTallanvor, an officer, but must accept escort when another guardsman arrives with orders to take Rand and the siblings to the queen. Rand notices the garden untouched by the extended winter as the guards lead the group through a maze of corridors before reaching an audience chamber. Rand follows behind Elayne, mimicking Gawyn's actions through the introduction, but peeking to see the queen, her general, andAes Sedaiadvisor. The queen admonishes the siblings for their disobedience. The Aes Sedai joins her, focusing on Elayne. Rand realizes she must beElaida do Avriny a'Roihanof whom he had previously heard. He does not know that she is of theRed Ajah, however.\n\nElayne gives her mother a premeditated speech that meeting Rand has helped her learn more about their subjects and realm. Morgase dismisses the notion with a confession that theTwo Riversprobably doesn't even know that they are a part ofAndor. The comment about the Two Rivers sparks Elaida's interest as she studies the differences between typical folk from western Andor and Rand. She approaches Rand and bares theheron markon his sword, which was previously wrapped with a red cloth,[2]for all to see. Her comments about the sword prompt every man in the audience to reach for swords. The Aes Sedai appears unconcerned and continues to question Rand, intrigued by the list of coincidences that led him here. The Aes Sedai's constant interrogation angers Rand and he begins to conceal the truth from her. Elaida, under command from the queen,Foretellsa dark future of Andor, one of pain and division. More quietly, with nobody else able to hear, she also Foretells to Rand that the entire world will see pain and division and Rand will be at the center of it.\n\nMorgase asks forGareth Bryne's advice on the matter. Bryne says that he believes Rand's story about being in the palace by accident and dismisses Elaida's public Foretelling as a rather obvious trajectory for the realm; nonetheless, he advises that Rand be imprisoned for a short while until Elayne and Gawyn leave the city with the Aes Sedai journeying toTar Valonwith Logain. Elaida agrees that holding Rand for a few weeks would give her good time to examine him further. Morgase weighs the advice of Elaida andGareth Brynein regards to Rand's fate and decides to free him against both their wishes, as there has been too much unfounded suspicion aboutDarkfriendsand the like in Caemlyn and she will not be part of it. After Rand swears under theLightthat he means no harm to them, Morgase dismisses him and gathers her advisers to speak about the problem withWhitecloaksin her city.\n\nRand follows the guards walking him out in a thoughtful state and barely notices it when they reach a small sally-port.

Egwene finally lets go ofsaidarand listens to Verin. Verin tells them Aes Sedai don't use the Power as a weapon. Verin says she could have talked them out of bullying them. Egwene apologizes to Bornhald but mentionsFalme. Bornhald accuses them of killing his father since he believes it was Aes Sedai, notSeanchanthat fought at Falme. The party rides off as Dain Bornhald tells them to remember his name.\n\n**Categories**\nThe_Dragon_Reborn_chapter_summaries, Chapter_summaries\n\n**Characters**\n- Egwene\n- Elayne\n- Nynaeve\n- Verin\n- Mat\n- Hurin\n- Bela(horse)\n- Dain Bornhald\n\n**Groups**\n- Aes Sedai\n- Whitecloaks\n\n**Places**\n- Tar Valon\n- Caralain Grass\n\n**Items**\n- Ruby-hilted dagger\n- Horn of Valere\n\n**Concepts**\n- Dreamer"

Siuan tells Moiraine that dispursing the bounty would only take a few months and she would be able to leave the Tower afterwards, but Moiraine tells Siuan that theHallmay have made her Queen ofCairhienby then. Siuan thinks Moiraine would make a great queen, but Moiraine tells her of the difficulty of being the monarch of Cairhien. The monarchy is under constant threat and must resort to unscrupulous tactics to maintain the throne. She does not want to be like her ruthless grandmother,Carewin Damodred.

The initial plan was to hideRandinTar Valonwhere they could instruct him in secret. Siuan is frustrated because Moiraine only sent her two messages since she leftTar Valon: one saying that she was entering theTwo Riversand one fromCaemlynsaying they were heading forFal Dara, rather than Tar Valon.\n\nThey examine theHorn of Valere, whichAgelmargave to Siuan as soon as she arrived. \"And prophecy said it would only be found just in time for the Last Battle.\" Agelmar knew that he had to be rid of it, because he desired to use it for glory while the prophecies say that it must be blown by one only thinking of salvation. Moiraine shows Siuan the brokenSealfurther confirming the last battle is imminent. Siuan recalls that she identified Rand when she saw him in the courtyard; she has theTalentto seeta'veren. Moiraine confirms that he is indeed theDragon Rebornand canchannelsaidin.\n\nMoiraine details her new plan. She has purposefully left Rand alone lest she trigger the infamousManetherenstubbornness. She will gently promptMatandPerrinto take the Horn toIllianandRandwill want to go with them. She will arrange for Rand present it to theCouncil of Nine. Everyone knows that the Horn is linked to the Dragon, and in finding it he will be able to proclaim himself the true Dragon and have theHunters of the Hornand Illian behind him immediately. Moiraine will not travel with them, so that Rand does not feel that he is doing the bidding ofAes Sedai. She has destroyed their clothes and will cleanse everyone before they leave so there will be no traces for theShadowspawnto follow. They also plan toHealMat of the taint from theruby-hilted daggerimmediately in Fal Dara, rather than going to Tar Valon. With Moiraine'sangreal, she and Siuan will only need two other trusted sisters, of which Leane can be one.\n\nMoiraine is careful about what she tells to Siuan, but she also cannot leave the impression that she is not telling everything.

Instead the Aes Sedai serve him withMeranaliterally serving them tea. Earlier, the Wise Ones told the clan chiefs that the Aes Sedai sided with Rand. But, the clan chiefs are still wary and believe Aes Sedai would do anything to get what they want. The topic changes to handling the survivingShaidothat fled fromDumai's WellstoKinslayer's Dagger. They agree that all Shaido should be killed or madeGai'shainwithin the next few months. Although it is against custom for Wise Ones to engage in fighting, their Wise Ones will deal with the traitorous Wise Ones of theShaido. Mandelain asks if they'll get to see theThree-fold Landagain. Rand slowly replies, \"I hope so,\" but knows theProphecy of Rhuideansays he'll destroy the Aiel. The clan chiefs depart on good terms with Rand.\n\nFor a brief moment, Rand looks at the scattered maps on the floor. He feels overwhelmed by his many priorities fromTar ValontoIlliantoGhealdan, from Shaido to Asha'man to Forsaken, and with bothAlannaandLews Therinin his head.\n\nBerelainstorms in withAnnourato protest being sent back toMayene. It was for her own safety due to a recent assassination attempt likely related toColavaeresympathizers targeting her. Berelain says it was nothing, plus she is best suited to handle theAtha'an Mierewho still await an audience with Rand and how crucial both sides are to each other. Rand wonders why she works so hard to keep the thankless position of interim leader of Cairhien, but realizes she must use every opportunity and connection to protect her small nation of Mayene. He clumsily guarantees something for Mayene. She clarifies that new allies gain his favor while her past service will be forgotten leaving Mayene at risk. Quietly, he asks if she'd still serve even if it meant leaving.\n\nCadsuane Melaidhrinenters abruptly. Annoura gasps thinking Cadsuane was dead. Merana screams she mustn't harm Rand. Rand feels a woman channeling saidar. Tensions rise and bothAsha'manandMaidensgo to high alert. Cadsuane coolly reassures Annoura she's very much alive, scolds Merana to calm herself, and ignores Rand's questions while inspecting the Asha'man. Again, he asks her who she is and why she's here. She continues ignoring him until finally acknowledging that Moiraine didn't teach the Dragon Reborn better manners. Cadsuane compliments Berelain's beauty and curtsies deeply, yet politely dismisses Berelain so she can talk to Rand. Surprisingly, Berelain reminds him about meetingHarine din Togara Two Windsof the Atha'an Miere and politely leaves.\n\nCadsuane insults Rand by criticizing the ornate decor, asking for tea, and calling him a \"good boy.\" Fuming, he asks why she's here for the 3rd time. Cadsuane calmly explains she is a Green, but as the oldest living Aes Sedai she's helped put away many male channelers, often in tears. Feeling threatened, Rand smashes the tea set into a wall mirror with the One Power. Calm as ever, she says she knows Rand's future and present, and coolly asks whether he's begun hearing voices. He demands an explanation, feelingLews Therinlistening inside. Apparently, some male channelers hear voices as they fall into madness. The two Asha'man guards, Dashiva and Narishma, react oddly. Rand begins doubting his sanity and Lews Therin's existence. Finally, she says Rand is young and overwrought, so she'll leave to catch up with Merana and Annoura while he calms down a bit. Rand screams for everyone to get out. Once the room is empty, he hurls theDragon Scepterinto a chair and begins questioning his sanity over and over.\n\nThe door opens quietly and Riallin brings in Head of the SchoolIdrien Tarsin. She bursts into tears and falls into Rand's chest. After she delivers her news, Rand wants to weep too.[1]\n\n**Categories**\nA_Crown_of_Swords_chapter_summaries, Chapter_summaries\n\n**Characters**\n- Rand\n- Lews Therinin Rand's head\n- Merana\n- Indirian\n- Mandelain\n- Janwin\n- Dashiva\n- Narishma\n- Sorilea\n- Riallin\n- Berelain\n- Annoura\n- Cadsuane Melaidhrin\n- Idrien Tarsin\n\n**Places**\n- Sun Palace\n- Cairhien (city)\n\n**Items**\n- Dragon Scepter"

He manages to anchor himself lightly in the Pattern to avoid being drawn into emptiness and to be able to perceive time.\n\nHe realizes this will be far more than a simple sword fight, asMoridinhad led him to believe. TheDark One, addressing Rand asAdversary, agrees saying that Moridin was of him, but his eyes were too small.Lews Therinhad no experience with the Dark one talking to him; Rand considers this a good sign. The Dark One brings his force against Rand. The real battle starts.\n\nSlayer's arrow had impaled Perrin from shoulder to back. Weak and confused, he has shifted to an unfamiliar location with strange trees around him. He is even too weak to imagine the arrow out of his shoulder. He contacts nearby wolves, but they're completely unfamiliar withWolfbrothersand shove him out of their minds.Cyndanearrives and looks down at Perrin in disappointment. He begs her for help. But, realizing Perrin is not the strong ally she hoped for, she vanishes.\n\nIn a daze, he shifts to theField of Merrilorhoping to findFaile. Once there, he realizes she can't be there since he's in thewolf dream. He recalls the portal Rand had ordered to be made in Merrilor, if only he could last. Perrin collapses and begins drifting into nothingness thinking,\"At least... at least I was there for Rand.\"\n\nSome hundredBandguards,Cha Faile, and caravan workers finally make camp for the night. Faile gathersMandevwin,Aravine,Harnan,Setalle, andArrelato discuss whyBerishasent them into theBlightand where they are located. Was it the trap of a Darkfriend or merely a mistake during the chaos of thebubble of evil? Faile thinks Berisha's wound was intentionally from a knife instead of accidentally from a spike. She asks Setalle whether an Aes Sedai could trace them. Setalle explains tracing is possible by reading a weave's residue, but residues only last a few days and reading them is a rare talent. Faile suspects Setalle is a former Aes Sedai due to the unusual knowledge and authority she projects.\n\nThey decide to wait one day for rescue before traveling onwards. A months-long escape southwards isn't realistic, given that two caravan workers have already died from the Blight's common dangers in only one day. Setalle reluctantly suggests traveling east towards the peak ofShayol Ghul. Surrounding Shayol Ghul are theBlasted Lands, which even the Blight avoids. With the Shadow's armies preoccupied with Rand, Faile and her caravan might be able to reach his armies and travel via gateway to the Field of Merrilor. Faile suspects a Darkfriend killed Berisha and still hides among her group.\n\nPrivately, Faile asks Setalle how many years it's been. Setalle finally admits it's been decades since she was in the White Tower. Unfortunately, she's been unable to channel in over 25 years so gateways are impossible and walks away. Faile wonders if Setalle is the Darkfriend and plotting to deliver theHorn of Valereright into the Dark One's hands.\n\nAviendha and the others fought the Shadow throughout the night, including a surprising number ofred-veils. They were not truly Aiel since they ignoredji'e'toh. She recognizes one red-veil corpse asSoro. He was kind to a young Aviendha and, as per Aiel custom, left to\"spit in Sightblinder's eye\".\n\nTo avoid exhausting the channelers, Aviendha had setup a system of rotating circle members. Currently, she held the turtle brooch angreal in a circle withFlinn,Sarene,Kiruna, andFaeldrin. Their circle heads towards fire flashing along the side of the valley, until Aviendha raises a hand. She sneaks onwards alone andDelveseach corpse to ensure no one is playing dead. Aiel and red-veils continuously rove the valley trying to best each other. A group ofsiswai'amanrush against two red-veil channelers, but are hurled back by a blast of Earth. Aviendha quickly strikes back with weaves of Fire and Earth, killing them.\n\nDespite her lack of skill in Healing, she saves onesiswai'amanfrom bleeding out from a throat wound when a shock goes through her. One of her wells of power vanishes from the circle. She immediately releases the circle and dashes back only to find the smoldering corpses of Kiruna and Faeldrin.Hessalamsmiles with Sarene under Compulsion while her warder lies at her feet. They vanish by twisting in upon themselves, again Traveling without a gateway. Flinn has survived but his left arm has been burned away.

      "text": "**Summary**\nThe first part of the chapter is a meeting betweenMatandVerin, with other members of theBandpresent. Verin first relates how she came to find Mat despite her intentions ofTravelingtoTar Valon. The journey involves her being pulled strongly by theta'verennature of Mat in such a way as to prevent her Traveling directly to Tar Valon. Instead, she ends up meeting Mat nearTrustair, although she was unsure prior to meeting Mat whether thet'averenshe would be meeting would be him orPerrin.\n\nVerin then offers a deal to take the Band directly toCaemlyn. Before telling Mat the details, she tells him that she received the picture of Mat from aDarkfriendand recommends that he be careful. The cost of the deal is that Verin will take theBandto Caemlyn on the condition that Mat agrees to open a sealed letter of instructions ten days after arriving. They end up compromising that Mat will either open the letter after ten days or that he will burn the letter unopened after remaining in Caemlyn for thirty days. Verin does, however, state that she hopes to relieve him of the letter before the ten days are up. Before ordering the camp to break, Mat notices that Verin has a stack of sealed letters inside her satchel.\n\nFortuona Paendrag, now theEmpressofSeanchan, is thinking about her former name—Tuon—and how it will be a notation in history. She is seeing the soldiers going on theRaidonTar Valonoff. The raid consists of 200 members of theFists of Heaven, fifty pairs ofsul'damanddamane, and five members of theBloodknives. The raid will reach Tar Valon using hundreds ofto'rakenand a flock ofraken. Due to rediscovery of Traveling, the raid is leaving after sunset and away fromEbou Darin order to remain a secret. The raid involves innovative tactics of launching the attack from theto'rakeninstead of from a staging point, which Fortuona thinks could be a bold new tactic or a disaster. Fortuona, in a conversation withSelucia, says that, as a consequence of the raid, theDragon Rebornwill certainly be against them. Until now, he wasn't, just Seanchan were against him.  And this will make a big difference.\n\n**Categories**\nThe_Gathering_Storm_chapter_summaries, Chapter_summaries\n\n**Characters**\n- Abaldar Yulan\n- Dali\n- Fortuona Paendrag\n- Malahavana\n- Mandevwin\n- Matrim Cauthon\n- Selucia\n- Talmanes Delovinde\n- Thomdril Merrilin\n- Tomas\n- Verin Mathwin\n\n**Groups**\n- Aelfinn\n- Aes Sedai\n- Asha'man\n- Band of the Red Hand\n- Bloodknives\n- Brown Ajah\n- Damane\n- Darkfriend\n- Eelfinn\n- Fists of Heaven\n- High Blood\n- Sul'dam\n- Warder\n\n**Places**\n- Trustair\n- Ebou Dar\n\n**Items**\n- Lily broochangreal"
