## 🔧 Development Status

**Current Phase**: Week 1 - Environment Setup ✅

**Completed**:

- ✅ Python environment configuration
- ✅ Ollama integration
- ✅ Data organization
- ✅ Utility modules (config, logging, constants)
- ✅ Test queries defined

**Next Phase**: Week 2 - Book Processing Pipeline

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Ollama Not Found

```bash
# Check Ollama is running
ollama list

# Restart Ollama if needed
# (Close from system tray and restart)
```

### Import Errors

```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
venv\Scripts\activate

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ChromaDB Issues

```bash
# May need Visual C++ Build Tools
# Download from Microsoft
pip install chromadb --no-build-isolation
```

### Data Not Found

- Check paths in `.env` match your actual directory structure
- Use absolute paths (e.g., `C:\Users\...`)
- Verify files are in `data/raw/books/` and `data/raw/wiki/`
